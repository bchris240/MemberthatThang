## Description

The Work Day Scheduler is a web application designed to help users plan their daily work schedule effectively. The app provides a clean and intuitive interface, displaying time blocks for standard business hours (9 AM to 5 PM). Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it's in the past, present, or future, providing a visual cue for users.

The application utilizes the Day.js library to manage date and time, ensuring accurate and dynamic time block creation. Users can enter events for each time block, and the app saves this information in the browser's local storage. This means that even if the user refreshes the page, their schedule remains intact.

## Features
